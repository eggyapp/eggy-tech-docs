## Version control: branch for Chapter 5

Before making changes, create a fresh branch for the testing and debugging updates:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/testing-debugging
```

You will commit the extra scripts, docs, or config tweaks you create while testing, then open a PR when the chapter is done.

When you finish this overview, follow **Testing** to exercise the endpoints and **Debugging** to troubleshoot problems.
