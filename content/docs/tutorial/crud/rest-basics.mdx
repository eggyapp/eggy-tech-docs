description: Understand how REST APIs map HTTP verbs and URLs to actions.

## Why learn this first?

Before we wire up controllers and services it helps to understand the vocabulary used in REST APIs. Knowing what a **resource**, **route**, or **HTTP verb** means makes the controller code much less mysterious.

## Key REST ideas

- **Resource**: A noun that represents something in your system (for example, `Task`).
- **Endpoint / Route**: The URL you expose for that resource, often combined with an HTTP verb (`GET /tasks`).
- **Representation**: The JSON payload you send back (or receive) that describes a resource.
- **Statelessness**: Each request contains all info the server needs—no hidden session state.

## Common HTTP verbs

| Verb | Typical meaning | Example in this project |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `GET` | Read data | `GET /tasks` lists tasks |
| `POST` | Create a new record | `POST /tasks` adds a task |
| `PATCH` | Update part of a record | `PATCH /tasks/:id` toggles `done` |
| `DELETE` | Remove a record | `DELETE /tasks/:id` deletes a task |

<Callout title="Beginner tip">
When you see decorators like `@Get()` or `@Post()` in Nest, think of them as aliases for the HTTP verbs above.

## Route patterns

- Plural nouns keep things consistent: `tasks`, `users`, `projects`.
- Use `:id` in the path to capture a specific record (`/tasks/:id`).
- Query parameters (e.g., `/tasks?done=true`) are great for filters and pagination.

## Request and response flow

1. **Client sends a request** using an HTTP verb, URL, optional body, and headers.
2. **Controller decorator** catches the request (e.g., `@Get('tasks/:id')`).
3. **Controller method** validates/unwraps parameters and calls the service.
4. **Service** performs the database work and returns plain data.
5. **Controller** sends a JSON response (Nest handles serialization for you).

## Error handling conventions

- Return `400 Bad Request` when the data is invalid (handled by Zod validation).
- Throw `404 Not Found` when the requested `id` does not exist.
- Use `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected failures (Nest does this automatically if an uncaught error bubbles up).

With these concepts in mind, you’re ready to build the actual service and controller. Continue to **Implement CRUD Service** to write the data layer, then wire it up in **Controllers & Routes**.
