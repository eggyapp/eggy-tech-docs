description: Build the Task service and expose REST endpoints.

## What you'll learn

- The REST concepts that guide the endpoints in this chapter
- How to move from data logic to HTTP endpoints step by step
- Where each part of the CRUD flow (service, controller, routes) will be built

<Callout title="What does CRUD mean?">
CRUD stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. These four actions cover the core lifecycle of most resources:

- **Create** – add a new record (e.g., `POST /tasks`).
- **Read** – fetch existing data (e.g., `GET /tasks`).
- **Update** – modify part of a record (e.g., `PATCH /tasks/:id`).
- **Delete** – remove a record (e.g., `DELETE /tasks/:id`).

Every endpoint you’ll build in this chapter maps to one of these operations.
</Callout>

This chapter is split into focused pages:

1. **REST Basics** – plain-language primer on resources, HTTP verbs, and routes.
2. **Controller + Service Pattern** – understand how Nest splits responsibilities before coding.
3. **Service** – implement the database-facing logic with NestJS + MongoDB.
4. **Controller & Routes** – expose that logic over HTTP.

Work through the pages in order. By the time you reach the controller page, the REST vocabulary and service code will already be familiar.


## Version control: branch for Chapter 4

Start this chapter from a clean `main`, then create a new branch so the CRUD work is isolated for review:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/crud-implementation
```

Commit each slice of work (service, controller, tests) as you complete it.
