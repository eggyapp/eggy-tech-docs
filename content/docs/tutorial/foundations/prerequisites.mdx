## Overview

This tutorial assumes you are comfortable typing commands in a terminal but may be brand new to backend development. We explain each step and link to longer articles if you want to dive deeper.

### Time commitment

- **Estimated duration**: 90–120 minutes
- Work through the chapters in order: Foundations → Environment & Configuration → Data Modeling → CRUD Implementation → Testing & Debugging → Next Steps

### Required tools

| Tool | Why we need it | Install link |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Node.js 20 LTS** | Runs NestJS and command-line tooling | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| **npm** | Package manager that ships with Node.js | Included with Node installer |
| **Nest CLI** | Generates project files and helps run the server | `npx @nestjs/cli@latest --help` or `npm install -g @nestjs/cli` |
| **Git** | Version control; optional but recommended | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| **GitHub account** | Hosts your repository and PRs | [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) |
| **Code editor** | Write code (VS Code recommended) | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| **MongoDB** | Database. Use Docker or MongoDB Atlas (cloud) | See options below |
| **API client** | Test endpoints (curl, [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) | Optional |

> **Tip**: If you haven’t installed command-line tools before, follow the official guides linked above. Each installer walks you through the process step-by-step.

### Check your versions

Open a terminal and confirm everything is available:

```bash tab="macOS/Linux"
node --version    # should print v20.x.x
npm --version     # any 10.x+ version
npx --version     # checks npx availability
git --version
```

```powershell tab="Windows PowerShell"
node --version    # should print v20.x.x
npm --version     # any 10.x+ version
npx --version     # checks npx availability
git --version
```

If `npx` or `nest` is not found, it simply means you did not install the CLI globally. That’s okay—you can still run `npx @nestjs/cli ...` in the next steps.

### Choose your MongoDB path

You need one of the following:

1. **Docker container**
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Run the compose file provided in [Local Development](/docs/backend/local-development)
   <Callout title="Pros">
   - Works offline once Docker images are downloaded.
   - Easy to reset—stop the container and start fresh if you break something.
   - Matches typical professional local-development setups, so skills transfer directly.
   </Callout>

   <Callout title="Cons" type="error">
   - Docker Desktop is a large install and can feel overwhelming the first time.
   - Needs sufficient disk space and CPU/RAM; older laptops may struggle.
   - Container networking adds extra terminology (ports, volumes) to learn.
   </Callout>
2. **MongoDB Atlas free tier**
   - Create a free account at [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
   - Set up a Cluster (M0 free tier) and create a database user
   - Use the connection string later in the setup page
   <Callout title="Pros">
   - No local installs beyond the app itself—helpful on school-issued or low-spec hardware.
   - Web UI shows collections/documents visually, which aids understanding.
   - Teaches you how real production databases authenticate and whitelist IPs.
   </Callout>

   <Callout title="Cons" type="error">
   - Requires an internet connection; slow Wi-Fi makes requests feel laggy.
   - Initial setup (account, project, network access) has several screens to complete.
   - Copying the connection string precisely is easy to mess up; mistakes create confusing auth errors.
   </Callout>

We will remind you when to switch between local Docker and Atlas.
