## Why foundations matter

Before touching any code it helps to understand the tools NestJS relies on. This page explains the high-level concepts; the step-by-step pages that follow will put them into practice.

## npm in a nutshell

- **npm** stands for *Node Package Manager*. It ships with Node.js and lets you install third-party libraries.
- The command `npm install <package>` downloads the package into the local `node_modules/` folder and records it in `package.json`.
- Use `npx` to run CLI tools temporarily without installing them globally (e.g., `npx @nestjs/cli new task-api`).

> **Tip**: You can view every available npm script by running `npm run` with no arguments.

## What is `package.json`?

Every Node project includes a `package.json` file that describes the app:

```json
{
  "name": "task-api",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nest start",
    "start:dev": "nest start --watch"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@nestjs/common": "^10.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nestjs/cli": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```

- `scripts` define shortcuts like `npm run start:dev`.
- `dependencies` list packages needed at runtime.
- `devDependencies` list packages used only during development (testing, build tooling, etc.).

## Dependency types

- Use `npm install <package>` for runtime dependencies.
- Use `npm install -D <package>` (or `--save-dev`) for development-only tools such as linters or testing libraries.
- Removing a package requires two steps: `npm uninstall <package>` and deleting any custom code that referenced it.

With these concepts in mind, continue to **Prerequisites** to set up your machine, then follow **Project Setup** and **Project Tour** to see how these ideas appear in a real NestJS project.
