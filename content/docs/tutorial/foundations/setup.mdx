## Overview

In this step you create a brand-new NestJS project, add MongoDB support, and confirm everything runs. Every command is followed by a short explanation so you understand what just happened.

### 1. Create a fresh folder (optional)

Pick a place on your computer to hold the tutorial project. In the terminal:

```bash tab="macOS/Linux"
mkdir nest-mongo-tutorial
cd nest-mongo-tutorial
```

```powershell tab="Windows PowerShell"
mkdir nest-mongo-tutorial
Set-Location nest-mongo-tutorial
```

### 2. Generate a Nest project

Use the Nest CLI to scaffold the project. The `nest new` command asks for a project name and installs dependencies.

```bash tab="macOS/Linux"
npx @nestjs/cli new task-api
cd task-api
```

```powershell tab="Windows PowerShell"
npx @nestjs/cli new task-api
Set-Location task-api
```

- `npx` downloads the CLI temporarily so you don’t need it globally.
- When prompted for the package manager choose **npm**.

### 3. Install dependencies (automatically)

The Nest CLI runs `npm install` for you. When the command finishes you should see a `Successfully created project` message. If installation fails (for example because you were offline), run `npm install` manually inside the project folder.

### 4. Run the starter app

Check that everything works before adding custom code:

```bash tab="macOS/Linux"
npm run start:dev
```

```powershell tab="Windows PowerShell"
npm run start:dev
```

- `start:dev` uses the Nest CLI dev server to watch files and restart automatically.
- The console should print `Nest application successfully started`.
- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the default “Hello World” response.

When you’re done, press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C`) in the terminal to stop the server.

### 5. Initialize Git and push to GitHub

Set up version control before adding custom code:

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bootstrap NestJS project"
```

1. Create a new GitHub repository (no template, no README) at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2. Follow the post-creation instructions to add the remote, for example:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/task-api.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

You now have a clean `main` branch synced with GitHub. Future chapters will build on this starting point.
